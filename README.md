# ECommerce
This project is an eCommerce application. 

The homepage displays a sidebar with a list of all categories and the products of the default category. 
Products are updated via AJAX when a new category is selected. 

The product page displays the product title, image, description and price for the product along with a drop-down list 
that the user can use to select the quantity. 
Users can then add a product to their cart via AJAX. 
When the user adds a product to their cart they are given the option to keep shopping or view their cart via a modal. 

Users can view their cart where they can update the the quantity or delete products. 

The project uses a login system so that authorized users can manage categories and products. 

This project uses Entity Framework, AJAX, authorization, and session.
